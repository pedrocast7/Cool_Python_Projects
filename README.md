# Cool Python Projects 🚀🐍

This repository is a work in progress. I'm collecting small, fun, and educational Python projects I found cool to share my journey as a programmer. Expect experiments, learning notes, and code snippets as I build and improve them.

## Structure
- The folders are named suggestively with the projects content and have a documentation if needed.


## Contributing
Suggestions and PRs are welcome. Open issues for ideas or improvements. ✨

Thanks for stopping by — follow the progress and enjoy the experiments! 👋
